### Details page for each Pokemon
* I might use Gatsbyjs to take advantage of built-in features like pre-fetching and route-based code splitting for performance, image optimization across devices.


### The table
* pagination (if the data set could grow)
* columns
  * add more fields that would benefit from comparison among Pokemon
* more colorful and fun
* clear all button
* responsive - TBD: technical data at work is most often viewed on full-size screens, so it may not make sense to constrain the eventual richness of the UI to accommodate all device screen sizes.

### CSS
* implement all CSS as Tailwind utility classes. I'm warming up to the [benefits](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) of this approach.
  * at this point, I think vanilla CSS is more clear for a team that has not decided to use Tailwindcss

### Data fetching
* axios if the data were dynamic
* GraphQL endpoint if the data were huge
